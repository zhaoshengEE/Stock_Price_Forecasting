# Stock_Price_Forecasting
### In this project, we implement various ML models to conduct stock price forecasting on GME price in two different tasks, namely, the next-day forecast and the 30-day forecast. 
### There are six models we built:
#### linear regression (LR);<br>
#### support vector regression (SVR);<br>
#### backpropagation neural network (BPNN);<br>
#### simple recurrent neural network (RNN);<br>
#### long short-term memory (LSTM) network;<br>
#### gated recurrent units (GRU) network;<br>
The GME price data is located in `Data` folder
`Img` folder contains the graph of prediction result on close price via each model
The \*\_`Model` folders saved the trained models respectively.
