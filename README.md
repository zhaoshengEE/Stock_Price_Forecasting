# Stock_Price_Forecasting
## In this project, we implement various ML models to conduct stock price forecasting on GME price in two different tasks, namely, the next-day forecast and the 30-day forecast. 
## There are six models we built:
# linear regression (LR);
# support vector regression (SVR);
# backpropagation neural network (BPNN);
# simple recurrent neural network (RNN);
# long short-term memory (LSTM) network
# and gated recurrent units (GRU) network
Img folder contains the graph of prediction result on close price via each model
